The concept demonstrates the design of a website that allows the user to book hotels, flights, car rentals and tours. The project involves advanced CSS concepts like CSS Flexbox, BEM methodology and 7-1 architecture. It uses no CSS libraries for any aspect of the project, from grid system to the animations. The whole layout and animations are developed using inbuilt features of CSS.
