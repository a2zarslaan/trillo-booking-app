# Trillo Booking App

This project aims at developing a responsive, desktop-first e-commerce website of a tour provider from scratch, using SASS. The concept demonstrates the design of a website that allows the user to book hotels, flights, car rentals and tours. The project involves advanced CSS concepts like CSS Flexbox, BEM methodology and 7-1 architecture. It uses no CSS libraries for any aspect of the project, from grid system to the animations. The whole layout and animations are developed using inbuilt features of CSS.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to strengthen and refresh my CSS skills and get well versed with the latest industry techniques and workflows. This was the most important factor leading to the decision of using only Vanilla CSS along with SCSS. The main focus of this project was to implement flexbox in a real life project. This project was inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's Advanced CSS Course on Udemy. The code is extremely organised, commented out and well-structured, so that it can further be used by developers as a CSS primer.

## Technologies Used
The project features the use of industry standard BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology which was used for structuring the project, the CSS 7-1 Architecture for a more manageable codebase, and SASS features such as mixins, variables and partials. Also, the project involves the use of flexbox for layout. The site includes the use of advanced media queries for responsive behavior that supports almost all of the popular screen sizes. Finally, a build pipeline was setup using npm scripts to handle tasks such as concatentation, compilation, prefixing and compressing to achieve a production ready code.
